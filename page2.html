            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury.
                In
                English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet"
                because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is
                distinctive
                among
                the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.

            <p>
                Mars is approximately half the diameter of Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total
                area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of
                Earth's
                mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity.
